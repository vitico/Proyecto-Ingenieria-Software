## Running the API
### Development
To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev-server
```
The developer mode will watch your changes then will transpile the TypeScript code and re-run the node application automatically.

### Production
First, create the `prod.env` file inside the `config` folder. Make sure that file contains all your production environment variables, like the `dev.env` file.

To build the API, run:
```bash
npm build
```
Then, start the application or deploy the files in `dist` directory:
```
npm start
```
